The book, which you can call a complete transcript of his presentation, cover many moments that affect his life in his childhood, university student, work life and relationship. He set his dreams when he was a child, and commit to them since then. A great inspiration for someone who works with computer like me.</p><h2>Quotes</h2><h3>Relationship</h3><ol><li>Don't finish someone's sentences. And talking louder or faster doesn't make your idea any better.</li><li>If you wait long enough, people will surprise and impress you.</li><li>Watch What They Do, <em>Not What They Say</em></li><li>A Bad Apology Is Worse Than No Apology.</li><li>Proper apologies have three parts:<ol><li>What I did was wrong</li><li>I feel badly that I hurt you</li><li>How do I make this better?</li></ol></li></ol><h3>How To Live</h3><ol><li>The brick walls are there for a reason. They're not there to keep us out. The brink walls are there to give us a chance to how how badly we want something.</li><li>Experience is what you get when you didn't get what you wanted.</li><li>Time is all you have. And you may find one day that you have less than you think.</li><li>Luck is indeed where preparation meets opportunity.</li><li><span id="reviewTextContainer470406484" class="readable"><span id="freeText17831765479674834442">Even if in a position of strength, whether at work or in relationships, you have to play fair. Just because you're in a driver's seat, doesn't mean you have to run people over.</span></span></li><li>If your car has a dent, you don't have to have it removed. It could be a statement of who you are. Not everything needs to be fixed.</li><li>Whether you think you can or can't, you're right.</li><li>If I could give three words of advice, they would be "tell the truth." If I got three more words, I'd add: "All the time."</li><li>We cannot change the cards we are dealt, just how we play the hand.</li><li>I mean, I don’t know how <i xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">not</i> to have fun. I’m dying and I’m having fun. And I’m going to keep having fun every day I have left. Because there’s no other way to play it.</li><li>Am I a fun-loving Tigger or am I a sad-sack Eeyore? Pick a camp. I think it’s clear where I stand on the great Tigger/Eeyore debate.</li><li>Sometimes, all you have to do is ask.</li></ol><h3>Work</h3><ol><li><span id="reviewTextContainer19929770" class="readable"><span id="freeText14759365834385401636">A lot of people want a shortcut. I find the best shortcut is the long way, which is basically two words: work hard.</span></span></li><li>Time must be explicitly managed, like money.</li><li>Ask yourself: Are you spending your time on the right things?</li><li>Complaining does not work as a strategy. We all have finite time and energy. Any time we spend whining is unlikely to help us achieve our goals. And it won’t make us happier.</li><li>It’s not how hard you hit. It’s how hard you get hit ...and keep moving forward.</li><li>Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.
